    "LEARNING GOALS: In this unit, you will: talk about an upcoming trip; talk about what you would like to do; talk about geographical features; read about unusual hotels; write a description of a place. PREVIEW THE UNIT: LESSON 1: Talk about an upcoming trip (Vocabulary: Verbs / Adjectives + prepositions, Grammar: Gerunds as objects of prepositions, Pronunciation: Blending: want to (“wanna”) and going to (“gonna”)); LESSON 2: Talk about what you would like to do (Vocabulary: Words to describe a place, Grammar: Would like / love / hate + infinitive, Conversation skill: End a conversation); LESSON 3: Talk about geographical features (Vocabulary: Geographical features, Grammar: Superlative adjectives, Pronunciation: Dropping the /t/ and linking in superlatives, Listening skill: Listen for specific information); LESSON 4: Read about unusual hotels (Reading skill: Identify point of view); LESSON 5: Write a description of a place (Writing skill: Include one topic per paragraph). PUT IT TOGETHER: Media project: Photos: Tourist destinations, Learning strategy: Learn grammar in context.",
    "GET STARTED: Choose a warm-up activity from the Warm-Up Activity Bank on page xxii. Instructions for teachers: Write the unit title on the board. Then ask the class, “Where are you going after class?” Elicit answers from Ss. Tell Ss to read the learning goals. Explain that 'upcoming' means happening soon; 'geographical features' are the interesting or important parts or qualities of a natural place. Direct Ss’ attention to the picture. In pairs, have Ss talk about what they see. Lead a class discussion. Ask Ss, “Where is this person?” (in the glaciers) “What is the person doing?” (hiking). Ask Ss if they have ever been to a similar place or done similar activities. Focus on the social media message. Ask, “What do you know about Mario?” (He is from Ecuador and travels a lot for work.) Have them read what Mario says in Meet the People of TSW Media on page 4 or play the video of Mario. Read Mario’s social media message aloud. Ask, “What does this quote mean?” Have volunteers explain it in their own words. Ask Ss, “Do you agree or disagree? Why?” Mario Calvo (@MarioC) says: “Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.” – Anonymous. Students should look at the photo of a vacation and discuss what they see, then read Mario’s message and discuss what the quote means.",
    "LESSON 1: TALK ABOUT AN UPCOMING TRIP. Mario Calvo (@MarioC): \"Visiting Mexico City next week. It’s a work trip, but I have some fun things planned!\" VOCABULARY: Verbs / Adjectives + prepositions. Listen. Then listen and repeat. Verbs and adjectives go with specific prepositions. These combinations are often followed by gerunds. Verb / Adjective - Preposition: be excited - about, approve - of, be worried - about, be afraid - of, dream - about, be fond - of, talk - about, be tired - of, think - about, take care - of, apologize - for, adapt - to, be responsible - for, be used - to, blame - for, feel up - to, prepare - for, look forward - to, thank (someone) - for, object - to, be interested - in, believe - in, engage - in, participate - in, succeed - in. PAIRS: Student A, say a verb or adjective from 1A. Student B, say the preposition.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 1 VOCABULARY: Read the title of the lesson. Say, \"This weekend I’m going camping in the mountains. I’m so excited!\" Ask Ss, \"Do you have any upcoming trips?\" Have them share in pairs. Read the social media message aloud. Ask the class, \"Where is Mario going on his upcoming trip?\" (Mexico City) \"What kind of trip is it?\" (a work trip) \"What do you think he has planned?\" Give Ss time to discuss their ideas in pairs. Encourage Ss to recall information about Mexican holidays and food from Unit 4. Say, \"Maybe Mario is going to Mexico to celebrate Independence Day.\" Ask, \"How did Mario describe this holiday?\" (lots of music, dancing, and fireworks; delicious food like molé chicken and chiles en nogada). Read the vocabulary title aloud. Have Ss look back at the first example in the grammar chart. Read it aloud. Ask Ss, \"Is 'am' a verb or an adjective?\" (verb) Say, \"Right! It’s the 'be' verb.\" Ask, \"Is 'interested' a verb or an adjective?\" (adjective). Have Ss look at 1A. Read the explanation aloud. Say, \"'Be interested' is a verb/adjective combination that goes with the preposition 'in'. Let’s hear what other combinations go with a specific preposition.\" Tell Ss to listen to the vocabulary, and then listen again and repeat. Play the audio. Have Ss circle any verbs or adjectives they are unfamiliar with. In pairs, have them share and compare their previous knowledge. Clarify the meaning of any new or confusing words. Arrange Ss in same-level pairs. Read the instructions aloud. Model the exercise with a higher-level S. Make sure Ss understand before moving on. Challenge higher-level Ss to complete the exercise without looking at the chart. LANGUAGE NOTE: Some of these verb/adjective combinations may appear with other prepositions. For example, 'excited' can be used with the preposition 'for' in addition to 'about', as in, 'I’m excited for you!' Different prepositions usually have slightly different meanings. EXTENSION: In pairs, have Student A say a verb or adjective. Have Student B respond with a complete sentence, including the correct preposition. For example, Student A: be excited; Student B: I am excited about my birthday.",
    "GRAMMAR: Gerunds as objects of prepositions. A gerund is a verb + ing. It is used the same way as a noun. A gerund is often the object of a preposition. Examples: I’m interested in learning more about Mexico City. She’s responsible for planning the trip. We look forward to hearing all about it. They talked about going to an unusual restaurant. He’s afraid of flying too far. FOR PRACTICE, GO TO PAGE 143.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 1 GRAMMAR: To introduce gerunds as objects of prepositions, write on the board: \"1. I am thinking about Mexican food. 2. I am thinking about traveling to Mexico.\" Ask, \"What is the verb in each sentence? What is the object?\" (1. verb: am thinking; object: Mexican food, 2. verb: am thinking; object: traveling to Mexico) Point out that an -ing word is both a verb and an object. Explain that -ing words can be used in many ways, depending on their position. Ask, \"What word in each sentence is a preposition?\" (about) Elicit other examples from the class. Have Ss open their books to the grammar chart. Read the explanation and examples aloud, pointing out the preposition placement before the gerund. Ask about contractions (e.g., 'I’m' or 'She’s') usage (spoken English and informal writing). Elicit -ing spelling rules: for most verbs, add -ing; for verbs ending in 'e', drop 'e' and add -ing. Ask about one-syllable verbs ending in vowel + consonant (double final consonant and add -ing), citing 'planning' as an example. In pairs, have Ss take turns saying the example sentences. EXTENSION: Ask Ss to make 3–5 open-ended questions using verb/adjective and preposition combinations from the vocabulary chart (e.g., \"What is one thing you are worried about right now?\", \"Where have you always dreamed about traveling?\"). Ss work in pairs but write individually, then interview at least three classmates. Encourage notes and sharing interesting answers.",
    "PRONUNCIATION: Blending: want to (“wanna”) and going to (“gonna”). We often blend 'want to' together as “wanna” /wɑnə/. We often blend 'going to' together as “gonna” /gənə/ when 'going to' comes before a verb (e.g., I’m going to leave soon). We do not blend 'going to' together before a noun (e.g., I’m going to Mexico City), but 'to' is usually unstressed /tə/. Examples: /gənə/: What are you going to do? /wɑnə/: I want to see the pyramids. Listen, notice the blended pronunciations, then listen and repeat. Listen. Complete the sentences. Then listen and repeat: 1. I’m going to Japan in the summer. 2. I’m going to take cooking classes. 3. I want to learn to make sushi. 4. My friend and I want to go hiking. 5. We’re talking about going to Canada. 6. I think we’re going to go in August. PAIRS: Make three sentences with 'going to' and 'want to' about another idea for a vacation.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 1 PRONUNCIATION: Read the Pronunciation box aloud about blending 'want to' (“wanna”) and 'going to' (“gonna”). Write on the board: \"1. She’s going to change jobs. 2. She’s going to a new company. 3. She’s going to participate in a new project.\" Ask, \"In which of these examples can we blend 'going to' as 'gonna'?\" (1, 3) \"Why?\" (It comes before a verb.) Read the directions aloud. Play the audio. Tell Ss, \"Listen. Complete the sentences with 'going to', 'gonna', or 'wanna'. Then listen again and repeat.\" Play the audio. Go over the answers as a class. After each sentence, ask, \"Why is this the correct answer?\" Arrange Ss in same-level pairs. Tell them to choose a vacation destination that interests them both. Ask them to make sentences using 'going to' and 'want to' about their upcoming trip. Join pairs to share their ideas. Monitor. Listen for the unstressed /ə/ sound in /wɑnə/, /gɑnə/, and /tə/.",
    "CONVERSATION: Listen or watch. Circle the correct answers: 1. Mario mainly talks about visiting Mexico City. 2. Mario goes to Mexico City a few times a year. 3. Mario hasn’t been on a hot air balloon tour. Listen or watch. Complete the conversation: Mario: I’m going to Mexico City next week. Have you ever been there? Eric: No, but I’m interested in visiting. What are you going to do? Mario: We talked about going to an unusual restaurant. Every dish on the menu includes insects. Eric: That sounds interesting. Mario: Yes. I’m excited! We’re also going to visit some museums. Eric: Well, I look forward to hearing all about it.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 1 CONVERSATION: Have Ss look at the video still. Ask, \"Who are these people?\" (Eric and Mario) \"What is their relationship?\" (co-workers, friends) \"Where are they?\" (in different offices) \"What are they doing?\" (talking on a video call). Give Ss time to preview the exercise. Ask, \"What do you think Eric and Mario are talking about?\" Have Ss listen or watch and complete the exercise. Ask, \"Were your predictions correct?\" Go over the answers as a class. Ask, \"How many times do you see the phrase 'going to' in the conversation?\" (three) Elicit the sentences and write them on the board, underlining 'going to': 1. I’m going to Mexico City next week. 2. What are you going to do? 3. We’re also going to visit some museums. Ask, \"Which of these can be blended together as 'gonna'?\" (2, 3) \"Why?\" (They come before verbs.) Play the audio and have Ss repeat. Put Ss in pairs to practice the conversation. Monitor and listen for correct pronunciation. Time permitting, have Ss swap roles and practice again. Have Ss make new conversations by substituting the highlighted words in 4B. Higher-level Ss can vary their responses and make longer conversations by adding details and asking and answering more questions. EXTENSION: Play the audio or video again. Have Ss focus on the men’s feelings. Ask: \"1. How did Eric feel when Mario told him about his meeting in Mexico City?\" (jealous) \"2. How does Mario feel about Mexico City?\" (enthusiastic) \"3. How did Eric feel when Mario talked about the restaurant that serves insects?\" (worried) \"4. How does Mario feel about eating insects?\" (excited).",
    "TRY IT YOURSELF: Listen and repeat. Then practice with a partner. PAIRS: Make new conversations. Use these words or your own ideas: Cancún, the aquarium (They have a lot of unique exhibits), go ziplining. MAKE IT PERSONAL: Think about a place you’re planning to visit. Why do you want to visit? What do you want to do there? Take notes. PAIRS: Talk about the place from 5A. Ask questions to get more information. Example: A: I’m interested in visiting Paris. I’ve never been there. B: That’s cool. What do you want to do there? I CAN TALK ABOUT AN UPCOMING TRIP.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 1 TRY IT YOURSELF: Copy the chart on the board. Model note-taking as you talk about a place you’re interested in visiting. Ask Ss, \"Where are you interested in visiting?\" Tell them to complete the chart with their own ideas. If possible, allow them to use their phones for research. Monitor and assist as necessary. Model the example conversation with a higher-level S. In pairs, have Ss take turns talking about places they’re interested in visiting. Encourage Ss to ask open-ended follow-up questions. Remind them to use the blended pronunciations 'gonna' and 'wanna' when appropriate. Have volunteers report back about their partners. LOOK FOR (while Ss are completing the Try It Yourself activity, make sure that Ss are correctly doing the following): using gerunds as objects of prepositions; using verb/adjective + preposition combinations; blending 'want to' (“wanna”) and 'going to' (“gonna”). EXIT TICKET: Write on the board, \"Where are you going to go? What do you want to do?\" Give Ss a few minutes to review the target vocabulary in the lesson and prepare an answer. Encourage lower-level Ss to write their ideas down. As Ss leave, ask them the questions on the board. Take notes on any common errors to identify areas for review in later lessons.",
    "LESSON 2: TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO. Mario Calvo (@MarioC): \"Dreaming of future vacations—where should I go?\" VOCABULARY: Words to describe a place. Listen. Then listen and repeat. Words: clean, polluted, safe, unsafe, ancient, modern, famous, not well known, touristy, unpopular, crowded, deserted. Listen to the descriptions. Write one adjective from 1A. More than one answer may be possible. Answers: 1. crowded, touristy; 2. unsafe, polluted; 3. modern; 4. deserted, unpopular; 5. safe; 6. ancient; 7. famous, touristy; 8. unsafe, deserted. PAIRS: Describe a place for your partner using two adjectives from 1A. Example: London is famous and touristy.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 2 VOCABULARY: Choose a warm-up activity from the Warm-Up Activity Bank on page xxii. Read the lesson title. Ask, \"What did we learn in Lesson 1?\" (to talk about an upcoming trip) \"What will we learn in this lesson?\" (to talk about what we would like to do). Have a volunteer read the social media message aloud. Ask Ss, \"Where do you dream of going on vacation?\" \"Where do you think Mario should go on vacation?\" Have Ss share their ideas in pairs. Tell Ss, \"You will learn six pairs of words to describe a place. In each pair, the words are opposites. What do we call words that are opposite in meaning to each other?\" (antonyms). Have Ss scan the pictures and captions before listening and circle unfamiliar words. In pairs, have Ss share and compare their previous knowledge. Tell Ss to listen to the vocabulary, then listen again and repeat. Play the audio. Tell Ss, \"You will hear eight descriptions of places. For each one, choose a word from 1A that best defines that place.\" Do number 1 as a class. Play the audio and pause. Ask, \"What is a word that describes this place?\" (crowded). Play the audio. Have Ss complete the exercise individually, noting multiple answers are possible. Replay if appropriate. Have Ss compare answers in pairs, then review as a class, asking Ss to explain choices and clarifying confusing words. Arrange Ss in same-level pairs. Say, \"Use the words in 1A to describe places.\" Read the example aloud. Ask Ss to use each word at least once and draw on personal experiences. Take a class survey (e.g., \"Who has been to Cancún? What is it like?\"). Invite volunteers to share experiences. LANGUAGE NOTE: 'Get to do something' is most often used informally to mean “to have the opportunity to do something.” For example, \"Did you get to visit the Louvre when you were in Paris?\" However, in Mario’s social media message, he is using it in a sarcastic or humorous manner as a joke. That is, he knows none of his friends are offering to take him there on vacation. EXTENSION: In pairs, have Ss find as many synonyms as possible for the vocabulary words in 1A. Remind them that a synonym means exactly or nearly the same. Encourage dictionary/thesaurus use. TEACHING TIP: Synonyms and antonyms are important tools for vocabulary expansion, helping Ss use a greater variety of words and avoid repetition. EXTENSION: In small groups, have Ss use the adjectives in 1A to describe their birthplace and current residence. Encourage follow-up questions.",
    "GRAMMAR: Would like / love / hate + infinitive. Use 'would (‘d) like / love / hate' to politely say what you want or don’t want. These are followed by an infinitive. Other verbs followed by an infinitive include need, plan, and prefer. Question Examples: Wh-word + Would + Subject + Like / Love / Hate + Infinitive (e.g., What would they like to do?). Statement Examples: Subject + Would (Not) + Like / Love / Hate + Infinitive (e.g., They would not like to go too late, or They would love to go to a restaurant, They would hate someplace crowded). Notes: Use 'would like, would love, and would hate' to talk about possible or imagined events (e.g., We would like / would love to go to China someday. I would hate to be late for the wedding). Use 'would like' as a polite way of saying 'want' or for offers/requests (e.g., Would you like to join us? Would your daughter like some ice cream?). Do not use 'like, would love, or would hate' in this context. Use the simple present form of 'like' to talk about general preferences (e.g., I like to travel to different countries. Ramzy doesn’t like to wake up early). FOR PRACTICE, GO TO PAGE 144.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 2 GRAMMAR: To introduce the grammar, say, \"I’d like to go to the movies this weekend.\" Ask Ss, \"What about you? What would you like to do this weekend?\" Elicit answers. Have Ss look at the grammar chart. As you read the first two sentences of the description aloud, ask, \"What is an infinitive?\" (to + base form of a verb) \"Find the infinitives in the examples\" (to do, to go). Explain that an infinitive is used only after certain verbs. Read the rest of the description and the example question and answer aloud, pointing out word order in the question and 'not' placement in the statement. Bring Ss’ attention to the first Note at the bottom of the chart. Read the explanation and examples aloud and provide further explanation (e.g., \"We would like to go to China someday. We can’t go now because we are busy, but this is a possible trip for the future.\"). Tell Ss they can make contractions by combining subject pronouns with the 'would' auxiliary in statements. Ask, \"How would you make the contraction of 'we would'?\" (we’d) Repeat for other subjects. Say, \"There are other reasons we use 'would like' in English.\" Read the second Note and example sentences aloud. Remind Ss they cannot use 'like, would love, or would hate' for this purpose. Provide additional examples if necessary. Read the third Note aloud. Provide additional examples if necessary. EXTENSION: In pairs, have Ss write three statements or questions using 'would (not) like / love / hate' followed by infinitives.",
    "CONVERSATION: Listen or watch. Circle the correct answers. 1. How does Eric describe the “Door to Hell”? (Answer: different). 2. What does Mario think about the “Door to Hell”? (Answer: He is surprised that Eric wants to go there). 3. Why does Eric want to visit Patagonia soon? (Answer: He’s afraid that it’s going to become crowded). Listen or watch. Complete the conversation: Mario: You like to travel, right? Eric: Yes, I do! I like to visit places that are not well known. Mario: Really? Like where? Eric: I’d love to go to Patagonia. Mario: Patagonia? Wow. I’d love to hear more about it. Eric: OK, sure. But I’m so sorry, I have to go now. I’ll tell you more later. CONVERSATION SKILL: End a conversation. When you want to end a conversation, say: \"Well, it was nice talking with you…\", \"I’ve got/I have to go now…\", \"I need/have to get going…\", \"I should be going now…\", or \"I’d love to keep talking with you, but…\" Example: A: I need to get going now. B: Sure. I’ll talk to you soon. Listen to or watch the conversation in 3A again. Underline the expressions that you hear above (e.g., I should be going now). Listen and repeat. Then practice with a partner. PAIRS: Make new conversations. Use these words or your own ideas: touristy, London.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 2 CONVERSATION: Have Ss look at the video still. Ask, \"What do you think Eric and Mario are talking about now?\" Give Ss time to preview the exercise items. Point out that quotation marks in “Door to Hell” indicate the name of a place. Then play the audio or video. Have them complete the exercise individually. Go over the answers as a class. If appropriate, replay the audio or video. Ask Ss to predict ways the gaps might be filled. Then have them listen or watch and complete the conversation. Review the answers as a class. Ask, \"Were your predictions correct?\" Play the audio again and have Ss repeat. Then in pairs, have Ss practice the conversation. Time permitting, have Ss swap roles and practice again. Focus on the Conversation Skill. Model the correct pronunciation and intonation of the expressions in the box. Have Ss repeat. Read the conversation in the skill box aloud with a higher-level S. Ask Ss to listen or watch the conversation in 3A again, underlining any expressions from the box they hear (e.g., \"I should be going now\"). Arrange Ss in same-level pairs to make a new version of the conversation in 3B by swapping highlighted words or using target vocabulary from 1A and their own ideas. Encourage Ss to practice ending the conversation with different expressions from the Conversation Skill. Higher-level Ss can make longer conversations by adding details and asking and answering more questions. Invite pairs to role-play their conversations for the class. EXTENSION: In pairs, have Ss talk about the places Eric wants to visit. First, ask them to recall details about the “Door to Hell” and Patagonia. If possible, show images of these two tourist destinations. Then ask Ss to talk to their partner about which trip they prefer and why. Finally, take a class poll to see which trip most Ss prefer.",
    "TRY IT YOURSELF: MAKE IT PERSONAL: Think about your vacation style. What kinds of places would you like to visit? What’s important to you when you travel? What do you like to avoid? Complete the chart. Example Chart: Kind of place: famous location; What’s important: modern, clean, lots of restaurants; What to avoid: unsafe and deserted areas. PAIRS: Talk about your chart in 4A. Describe the kinds of places you would and wouldn’t like to visit. Ask questions to get more information. Example: A: I’d love to visit somewhere famous that’s modern and clean. B: Really? Like where? I CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 2 TRY IT YOURSELF: Copy the chart on the board, leaving the boxes blank. Model note-taking as you talk about the vacation style described in the example entries. For example, \"I like to visit famous locations. It’s important to me that the place is modern, clean, and has lots of restaurants. I’d really love to avoid areas that are unsafe or deserted.\" Tell Ss to complete the chart with information about their own vacation style. Remind them to reference 1A for words to describe places. Monitor their work and provide help with vocabulary as necessary. OPTION: If possible, project images of places you’d like to visit. Point to each image as you describe the kind of place you want to visit. Have Ss share their charts in pairs. Model the example conversation with a higher-level S. Encourage them to ask additional open-ended questions to learn more about their partners. Invite volunteers to share any interesting or unusual places they heard about. LOOK FOR (while Ss are completing the Try It Yourself activity, make sure they are correctly): using adjectives to describe a place; using 'would like / love / hate + infinitive' to say what they want or don’t want; using appropriate expressions to end a conversation. EXIT TICKET: Write on the board, \"What’s your vacation style?\" Give Ss 2–3 minutes to write down as many ideas as they can. Then have them take turns asking and answering the question in small groups. Listen and take notes on areas for review and extra practice in later lessons. EXTENSION: Arrange Ss in mixed-level groups of 3–4. Their team’s task is to create a tourism brochure or poster that describes the best qualities of a not-yet-well-known destination and fun activities there. Have each group present their brochure/poster to the class and display them.",
    "LESSON 3: TALK ABOUT GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES. Mario Calvo (@MarioC): \"What’s the hottest place on Earth? The first person who answers gets to take me there on vacation!\" VOCABULARY: Geographical features. Listen. Then listen and repeat. Features: a mountain, a hill, a river, a lake, a pond, an ocean, a coast, a forest, an island, a volcano, a desert, a jungle. Look at the words in 1A. Write them in the correct category: Land (a hill, a mountain, a coast, a forest, an island, a volcano, a desert, a jungle), Water (an ocean, a river, a lake, a pond). PAIRS: Add 2–3 more geographical features to the list in 1A.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 3 VOCABULARY: Choose a warm-up activity from the Warm-Up Activity Bank on page xxii. Read the lesson title. Ask, \"What does 'geographical' mean?\" (relating to an area or place) \"What does 'feature' mean?\" (characteristic, attribute, trait, quality, property). Read the social media message aloud. Ask Ss, \"Where do you think the hottest place on Earth is? Would you like to go on vacation there?\" LANGUAGE NOTE: 'Get to do something' is most often used informally to mean “to have the opportunity to do something.” For example, \"Did you get to visit the Louvre when you were in Paris?\" However, in Mario’s social media message, he is using it in a sarcastic or humorous manner as a joke. That is, he knows none of his friends are offering to take him there on vacation. Have Ss scan pictures and captions before listening and circle unfamiliar words. In pairs, Ss share/compare knowledge. Tell Ss to listen to vocabulary, then repeat. Play audio. Remind Ss about pronunciation difference between noun 'desert' (dry land, stress first syllable) and 'dessert' (sweet food, stress second syllable). Tell Ss to categorize words from 1A into land and water geographical features. Draw chart, write examples, read aloud. Have Ss complete individually, compare in pairs. Review by inviting volunteers to write answers on board. Put Ss in new pairs. Have them discuss other geographical features and add 2–3 more to their charts from 1B. Invite volunteers to draw other features on the board and elicit names from class. TEACHING TIP: Suggest Ss write definitions and pronunciations in a vocabulary journal, separating multisyllable words and marking stressed syllables. EXTENSION: In pairs, have Ss share which geographical features are near where they live.",
    "GRAMMAR: Superlative adjectives. Use superlative adjectives to compare more than two people or things. Use 'the' or a possessive adjective (my / her, etc.) before the superlative. Rules: For most one-syllable adjectives, add -(e)st (e.g., high -> highest, large -> largest). For one-syllable adjectives ending in one vowel + one consonant, double the final consonant and add -est (e.g., hot -> hottest, big -> biggest). For two-syllable adjectives ending in 'y', drop the 'y' and add -iest (e.g., happy -> happiest, pretty -> prettiest). For most adjectives with two or more syllables, use 'least' or 'most' + the adjective (e.g., beautiful -> most beautiful, popular -> least popular). Notes: Superlatives are often used with prepositional phrases with 'in' or 'of' (e.g., Australia is the smallest continent of all). Some adjectives have irregular forms (e.g., good ➙ best, bad ➙ worst, far ➙ farthest / furthest). FOR PRACTICE, GO TO PAGE 145.",
    "Teacher Notes for LESSON 3 GRAMMAR: To introduce the grammar, write on the board, \"Disneyland is famous for being the happiest place on Earth.\" Read the example aloud. Underline 'happiest', and say, \"Happiest is a superlative adjective.\" Check Ss’ prior knowledge. Ask, \"What does superlative mean?\" Bring Ss’ attention to the grammar chart. Say, \"We use superlative adjectives to point out the number-one item in a group of three or more.\" Read the description aloud, and give examples (e.g., \"This is the highest building,\" \"This is my prettiest sweater\"). Write them on the board, underlining 'the' and 'my'. Ask Ss to write two additional superlatives using 'most' and 'least'. Invite volunteers to share their examples. LANGUAGE NOTE: The adjective 'far' has two superlative forms, 'farthest' and 'furthest'. 'Farthest' is used for physical distance (e.g., \"Which planet is farthest from the sun?\"). 'Furthest' is usually used figuratively, to mean most or greatest extent or degree (e.g., \"Studying physics is the furthest thing from my mind.\")."
